    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This waffle recipe is the only one you'll need to make homemade waffles
      with your waffle iron. Simple pantry ingredients mix up quickly in this
      easy batter that can be used right away or stored in the refrigerator for
      up to a week. Serve waffles hot with whipped cream and fresh fruit or with
      butter and maple syrup for either breakfast, brunch, or a snack.

        Flour: These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.

        Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter
        together.
